<h1>Text Generation Demos in Rust using Glyphon</h1>
<p>The purpose of this demonstration is to demonstrate how to add simple text features to an existing game project in rust. For our sample game project, we will be starting with the [scene2d example from the course website](https://cs.pomona.edu/classes/cs181g/examples/) You may choose to follow along using the same example, or another game project of your own.</p>
**The tutorials will build on each other, so don't attempt to do tutorial 3 without reading 1**
